Project 1

## Overview
The project is based on the augmented reality based instruction modules, actively growing in the manufacturing and maintenance sectors within the aerospace industry. A micro-level coordinate system is experimented with using multi-class classiication-based ML algorithms, to predict the maintenance step given a specific part and its coordinates. The device being ued in this project is an inverted of the 'FlightMax Fill Motion Simulator'.

There are 13 unique steps which, in this project is commonly referred to as a 'feature', these steps are defined within the process of disassembling the inverter. Each step has X, Y, Z axis points which are referred to as 'classes'. 

This project essentially takes data from data
